I'd love to get in touch with you and hear about your experiences in photonics and any oppurtunities. I am currently looking for an internhsip or research position for the summer of 2021. I'm also open to guest blogging about optics, photonics, being an engineering student, or related topics and would be thrilled to have others share their expertise and experiences on this blog.
